# üîç URL Health Monitor Tool

A Python-based tool to check the health of multiple URLs, log their status, and send email alerts when any are down. Designed for lightweight monitoring and suitable for real-time scheduling via Task Scheduler.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PreethamMadhamsetty/URL_health_monitor_tool.git
   cd URL_health_monitor_tool
   
2. **Install Dependencies**
It is recommended to create a virtual environment first
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Preparing Environment file**
   ```bash
   EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
   EMAIL_RECIPIENTS=recipient1@gmail.com,recipient2@gmail.com
‚ö†Ô∏è If you're using Gmail with 2-step verification, generate an App Password from your Google account.

4. **Add URLs to monitor**
Add all target URLs (one per line) in the urls.txt file. Example:
   ```bash
   https://example.com
   https://github.com
   https://httpstat.us/404

5. **Run the tool manually**
To test the tool:
   ```bash
   python -m monitor

6. **Automating with Task Scheduler**
Create a .bat file (e.g., run_health_check.bat) with the following content:
   ```bash
   @echo off
   cd /d "C:\Path\To\Your\Project"
   call .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   python -m monitor

**Note:** You can schedule this in Windows Task Scheduler by creating a new task and setting the execution time and the path to this `.bat` file.

**Example Output:**  
   ```bash
   [200] UP - Success for https://example.com  
   [404] Client Error - Not Found or Unauthorized for https://httpstat.us/404  
   [EMAIL SENT] Alert sent to: you@example.com

**Important Network Checks:**  
Ensure the machine running this tool has active internet connectivity. The URLs you want to monitor must be accessible from this server, and any firewalls or network security groups should allow outbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic to those endpoints.
